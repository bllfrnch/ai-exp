This is an MDX file. You can use components in here.

If you want to write content with components, you can do so with `.mdx` files. Here's an example:

import FormattedDate from '../../components/FormattedDate.astro';

<FormattedDate date={new Date()} />

This component was imported from `../../components/FormattedDate.astro`.

You can even import components that use other frameworks! Here's one for Preact, but you can do the same with React, Svelte, Vue, and Solid.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'preact/hooks';

const Counter = ({ children }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const add = () => setCount((i) => i + 1);
  const subtract = () => setCount((i) => i - 1);

  return (
    <>
      <div class="counter">
        <button onClick={subtract}>-</button>
        <pre>{count}</pre>
        <button onClick={add}>+</button>
      </div>
      <div class="counter-message">{children}</div>
    </>
  );
};
```

This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

import HeaderLink from '../../components/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
	Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>
